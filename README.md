#### In this project we will try to create a model to predict the diffusion of `Covid-19 in Africa`. The collected data and predictions will be integrated into a web application.

### The data used will come from the `Oxford University` website [ourworldindata.org](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv) as `main dataframe` and from [John Hopkins University](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv) for `recovered cases`.

### We plan to eventually include data sets from other sources in order to add features.
